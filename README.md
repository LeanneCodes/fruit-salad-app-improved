Fruit Nutrition Finder
======================

This is a simple web app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows a user to type in the name of a fruit and fetch its nutritional information and an image from two different APIs. The fruit is then added to a list on the page as a small card showing its name, image and calorie amount.

Each fruit card can be clicked to remove it from the list. When a fruit is added, its calories are added to the running total shown on the page. When a fruit is removed, its calories are subtracted from the total. The app uses the dataset property to store each fruit's calorie value inside the list item so it can easily be accessed later.

The app fetches nutrition data from a fruit API and images from Pixabay. It then builds the list items dynamically using JavaScript. The styling is kept clean and modern so the list of fruits looks like neat cards with soft shadows and rounded corners. The app can be expanded with animations, local storage or additional nutritional details if needed.
